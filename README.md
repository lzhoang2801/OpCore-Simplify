## ✨ **Features**

1. **Comprehensive Hardware and macOS Support**  
   Fully supports modern hardware. Use `Compatibility Checker` to check supported/unsupported devices and macOS version supported.

   | **Component**  | **Supported**                                                                                       |
   |----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | **CPU**        | Intel: Nehalem and Westmere (1nd Gen) → Arrow Lake (15th Gen/Core Ultra Series 2) <br> AMD: Ryzen and Threadripper with [AMD Vanilla](https://github.com/AMD-OSX/AMD_Vanilla) |
   | **GPU**        | Intel iGPU: Iron Lake (1nd Gen) → Ice Lake (10th Gen) <br> AMD APU: The entire Vega Raven ASIC family (Ryzen 1xxx → 5xxx, 7x30 series) <br> AMD dGPU: Navi 23, Navi 22, Navi 21 generations, and older series <br> NVIDIA: Kepler, Pascal, Maxwell, Fermi, Tesla generations |
   | **macOS**      | macOS High Sierra → macOS Sequoia |

2. **ACPI Patches and Kexts**  
   Automatically detects and adds ACPI patches and kexts based on hardware configuration.
   
   - Integrated with [SSDTTime](https://github.com/corpnewt/SSDTTime) for common patches (e.g., FakeEC, FixHPET, PLUG, RTCAWAC).
   - Includes custom patches:
      - Prevent kernel panics by directing the first CPU entry to an active CPU, disabling the UNC0 device, and creating a new RTC device for HEDT systems.
      - Disable unsupported or unused PCI devices, such as the GPU (using Optimus and Bumblebee methods or adding the disable-gpu property), Wi-Fi card, and NVMe storage controller.
      - Fix sleep state values in _PRW methods (GPRW, UPRW, HP special) to prevent immediate wake.
      - Add devices including ALS0, BUS0, MCHC, PMCR, PNLF, RMNE, IMEI, USBX, XOSI, along with a Surface Patch.
      - Enable ALSD and GPI0 devices.

3. **Automatic Updates**  
    Automatically checks for and updates OpenCorePkg and kexts from [Dortania Builds](https://dortania.github.io/builds/) and GitHub releases before each EFI build.

   - All download links are stored in `bootloader_kexts_data.json`.
            
4. **EFI Configuration**  
   Apply additional customization based on both widely used sources and personal experience.

   - Spoof GPU IDs for certain AMD GPUs not recognized in macOS.
   - Use CpuTopologyRebuild kext for Intel CPUs with P-cores and E-cores to enhance performance.
   - Disable System Integrity Protection (SIP).
   - Spoof CPU IDs for Intel Pentium, Celeron, Core, and Xeon processors.
   - Add custom CPU names for AMD CPUs, as well as Intel Pentium, Celeron, Xeon, and Core lines from the Rocket Lake (11th) generation and newer.
   - Add a patch to allow booting macOS with unsupported SMBIOS.
   - Add NVRAM entries to bypass checking the internal Bluetooth controller.
   - Properly configure ResizeAppleGpuBars based on specific Resizable BAR information.
   - Allow flexible iGPU configuration between headless and driving a display when a supported discrete GPU is present.
   - Force Intel GPUs into VESA mode with HDMI and DVI connectors to simplify installation process.
   - Provide configuration required for using OpenCore Legacy Patcher.
   - Add built-in device property for network devices (fix 'Could not communicate with the server' when using iServices) and storage controllers (fix internal drives shown as external).
   - Prioritize SMBIOS optimized for both power management and performance.
   - Re-enable CPU power management on legacy Intel CPUs in macOS Ventura 13 and newer.
   - Apply WiFi profiles for itlwm kext to enable auto WiFi connections at boot time.

   and more...

5. **Easy Customization**  
   In addition to the default settings applied, users can easily make further customizations if desired.

   - Custom ACPI patches, kexts, and SMBIOS adjustments (**not recommended**).
   - Force load kexts on unsupported macOS versions.
   - Support AirportItlwm on macOS Sequoia 15 with **temporary workaround**. Manually select AirportItlwm, IOSkywalkFamily IO80211FamilyLegacy and AMFIPass kexts, then apply the root patch from OpenCore Legacy Patcher.

## 🚀 **How To Use**

1. **Download OpCore Simplify**:
   - Click **Code** → **Download ZIP**, or download directly via this [link](https://github.com/lzhoang2801/OpCore-Simplify/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).  
   - Extract the downloaded ZIP file to your desired location.

2. **Running OpCore Simplify**:
   - On **Windows**, run `OpCore-Simplify.bat`.
   - On **macOS**, run `OpCore-Simplify.command`.
   - On **Linux**, run `OpCore-Simplify.sh`.

3. **Selecting hardware report**:
   - On Windows, there will be an option for `E. Export hardware report`. It's recommended to use this for the best results with your hardware configuration and BIOS at the time of building.
   - Alternatively, use [**Hardware Sniffer**](https://github.com/lzhoang2801/Hardware-Sniffer) to create a `Report.json` and ACPI dump for configuration manully.

4. **Selecting macOS Version and Customizing OpenCore EFI**:
   - By default, the latest compatible macOS version will be selected for your hardware.
   - OpCore Simplify will automatically apply essential ACPI patches and kexts. 
   - You can manually review and customize these settings as needed.

5. **Building OpenCore EFI**:
   - Once you've customized all options, select **Build OpenCore EFI** to generate your EFI.
   - The tool will automatically download the necessary bootloader and kexts, which may take a few minutes.

7. **Create USB and Install macOS**: 
   - Use [**UnPlugged**](https://github.com/corpnewt/UnPlugged) on Windows to create a USB macOS installer, or follow [this guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/installer-guide/mac-install.html) for macOS.
   - For troubleshooting, refer to the [OpenCore Troubleshooting Guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/troubleshooting/troubleshooting.html).

> [!NOTE]
> 1. After a successful installation, if OpenCore Legacy Patcher is required, simply apply root patches to activate the missing features (such as modern Broadcom Wi-Fi card and graphics acceleration).
> 
> 2. For AMD GPUs, after applying root patches from OpenCore Legacy Patcher, you need to remove the boot argument `-radvesa`/`-amd_no_dgpu_accel` for graphics acceleration to work.
